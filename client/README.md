A modern blogging platform that allows users to register, create posts, comment, and engage with a community.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Flowbite React**

### Backend
The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, providing a robust API for the frontend to interact with. It handles user authentication, post management, comments, and other core functionalities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the frontend locally:

### 1. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed (v16+ recommended).

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
IGNORE FOR NOW, we'll use it later
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Adjust the value depending on your backend URL.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be live at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
